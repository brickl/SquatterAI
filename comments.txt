General Structure of the code

Brick I'm not sure how much of the player/Squatter game you have changed


	-Used AIMA library and implemented the min-max tree alpha, beta pruning. 
	-Used floodfill to handle our checking of captured pieces.
	-SquatterGame class handles most of the grunt work for the algorithm, handling both the utility & get actions function. 
	-Get actions has a significant role, by returning the most useful moves for that boards state.Moves that are diagonal in nature have a higher priority as we have found these the most effective in game playing.
	-Utility function mainly checks to see if we will capture any pieces or if the opponent will capture any pieces. The simplicity of this method is too reduce computational complexity.
